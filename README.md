Here is a brief explanation of the key parts of the code:

Import Libraries: The script imports requests to fetch the webpage and BeautifulSoup from bs4 to parse the HTML content.

Get HTML Content: The script sends a GET request to the target URL and fetches the HTML content of the page.

Parse and Extract Data: Using BeautifulSoup, the script navigates the HTML structure to find specific elements like product titles, images, and prices. This is done by targeting HTML tags with specific classes.
